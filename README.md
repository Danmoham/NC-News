# Northcoders News API

For anyone wishing to do this locally you will need to set a PGDatabase and set it to the following below:
PGDATABASE=nc_news for the full database and PGDATABASE=nc_news_test for the test database, please ensure these are in the files .env-test and .env-development. Please also ensure that these two files are .gitignored.
